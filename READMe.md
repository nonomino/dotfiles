### Credits
This setup was possible only because of:
* [hidayry/dotfiles-bspwm](https://github.com/hidayry/dotfiles-bspwm/) and all the people whose  config I've shamelessly stolen.
* The awesome community on [r/unixporn](https://reddit.com/r/unixporn)
* Various GNU/Linux and _(insert tool name)_ forums.
